    Custom-built RESTful API to support server and database operations for a high-end fashion website that can scale to meet the demands of production traffic.

# About
I was tasked with re-engineering the backend of the "Questions and Answers" service of a fashion website frontend. I:
  * Constructed RESTful API to handle requests to a database system of my own choosing
  * Performed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process on a raw data set consisting of over twelve million records
  * Designed and build an API server to provide data to the client in the format specified by the API documentation
  * Optimized database and query methods for speed and response
  * Deployed to the cloud using AWS
  * Stress tested all API routes, checking for RPS (requests per second), latency, and error rate

The final product, when tested with <a href="https://loader.io">loader.io</a> with a maximum of 600 users per second, registered an average response time of 12 ms with a 0.0% error rate.
